# Belgian Golden Ale

Based on the Belgian Golden Ale recipe on [homebrewanswers.com](https://homebrewanswers.com/complete-guide-grain-brewing-beginner/)

Recipe scaled to use 2kg of pilsner malt because that was a convenient size to purchase. 11.5 litres also fits well in the stock pot.

## Ingredients

* 2kg pilsner malt
* 12g amber malt
* 14g saaz hops (boiled 60 min)
* 4g styrian golding hops (boiled 60 min)
* 5g styrian golding hops (boiled 20 min)
* 11g Fermentis Safbrew â€“ T-58 yeast
* 5.5 litre water (60 min wort)
* 5.9 litre water (15 min wort)

### Water

1 campden tablet added to ~20 litres collected ~20 hours previously

### Demerara sugar

25g from original recipe omitted by accident

### Munich malt

Original recipe suggested Munich malt. This was not available on eBay at the time so was substituted with Amber malt.

## Tasting notes

2020-05-10: Tasted ok. Flavour not particularly strong. Hoping will develop a bit further in final stage of fermentation.

2020-05-20: Really pleased with how this has turned out. Peppery aroma and quite a light body. Very drinkable

## Other notes

* Auto-syphon worked really well
* Could do with a bottling-wand
