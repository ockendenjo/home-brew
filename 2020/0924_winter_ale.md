# Winter Spiced Ale

Bought K9 Winter Warmer in December 2019 which I quite liked. Trying to produce a similar beer.

## Ingredients

* 2.0 kg maris otter malt
* 0.2 kg chocolate malt
* 0.2 kg light crystal malt
* 0.6 kg caramel malt
* 12.5 g willamette hops (boiled 60 min)  
* 12.5 g willamette hops (boiled 30 min)  
* 5 ground/crushed cardamom pods (boiled 1 min)
* 38 ml vanilla extract
* Crossmyloofbrew ale yeast
* 8.5 litre water (mash)
* 5.5 litre water (sparge)

### Water

1 campden tablet added to ~20 litres collected many hours previously

## Tasting notes

## Other notes

2020-09-24 Vanilla extract formed blobs and sank to bottom of the pan. Unsure how much flavour transferred. Most wort
racked to fermenter after cooling. Bottom section containing some trub transferred to demijohn and left to settle.

2020-09-30 Wort in demijohn started growing white spots (natural yeast). Left to ferment rather than racking back into
fermenter.

2020-10-28 I don't think the alcohol percentage is correct. I seem to remember adding some extra water to the fermenter.
Unfortunately I don't seem to have a record of how much, or when it was added relative to taking the initial specific
gravity reading. The beer tastes too strong and will need to be diluted a bit. The flavour is not particularly nice -
I will try to alter the flavour with further spice additions.

## Flavour adjustment

The following ingredients have been placed in a glass jar with roughly double the volume of cherry brandy (didn't have any vodka).

* 1/2 tsp cinammon
* 1/4 tsp ginger
* 1/8 tsp mixed spice
