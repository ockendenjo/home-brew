## Tasting notes

## Other notes

2020-09-24 Vanilla extract formed blobs and sank to bottom of the pan. Unsure how much flavour transferred. Most wort
racked to fermenter after cooling. Bottom section containing some trub transferred to demijohn and left to settle.

2020-09-30 Wort in demijohn started growing white spots (natural yeast). Left to ferment rather than racking back into
fermenter.
