# Citra IPA

Based on the Kernel Citra Double IPA recipe on [brewersfriend.com](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/295943/kernel-citra-double-ipa)

Recipe scaled (1/3) to use 2.5kg of Maris Otter pale malt

More water added to reduce alcohol percentage. I thought 9% alcohol to be too strong.

## Ingredients

* 2.5 kg maris otter malt
* 0.12 kg granulated sugar
* 10 g citra hops (added to first wort)
* 10 g citra hops (boiled 15 min)
* 15 g citra hops (boiled 10 min)
* 20 g citra hops (boiled 5 min)
* Crossmyloofbrew 'Five' yeast
* 8.5 litre water (mash)
* 5.5 litre water (sparge)

### Water

1 campden tablet added to ~20 litres collected ~20 hours previously
